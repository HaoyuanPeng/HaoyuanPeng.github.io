I am currently a senior algorithm engineer at ByteDance in Shanghai. Before joining ByteDance, I served as a senior researcher at Tencent in Shanghai, and subsequently at Learnable.AI. 
I was a member of [Shanghai Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/18/01/c24779a268289/page.htm), and I received my bachelor and master degrees from 
[Software School of Fudan University](https://software.fudan.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Prof [Xiaoqing Zheng](https://faculty.fudan.edu.cn/zhengxq/zh_CN/).

My major research interests focus on natural language processing (NLP) and multimodal information extraction.
