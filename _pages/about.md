I am currently a senior algorithm engineer at Learnable.AI in Shanghai. Prior to that, I was a senior researcher at Tencent in Shanghai. 
I was a member of [Shanghai Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/18/01/c24779a268289/page.htm), and received my bachelor and master degree from 
[Software School of Fudan University](https://software.fudan.edu.cn/), under supervision from Prof [Xiaoqing Zheng](https://faculty.fudan.edu.cn/zhengxq/zh_CN/).

My major research interests are about natural language processing (NLP) and multimodal information extraction.
