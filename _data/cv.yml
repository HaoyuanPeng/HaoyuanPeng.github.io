    - title: Senior Algorithm Engineer
      institution: Learnable.AI, Shanghai, China
      year: 2023 - present
      description:
        - Conduct research on enhancing the reasoning error detection capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology. Our work has been submitted to IJCAI 2024.
        - Train large-scale models ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters for real-world systems in the education domain. Applications include directly grading students' mathematical free-response answers and translating student responses into internally defined languages.
        - Investigate OCR result correction algorithms for scenarios involving student responses, effectively addressing the challenge of distinguishing between student writing errors and OCR recognition errors.
